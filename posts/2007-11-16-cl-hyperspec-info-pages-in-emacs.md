I just discovered the [following blog article][] by Bill Clementson, from way back in 2003.  Luckily, the links still worked, so I was able to get Info pages today for the Common Lisp HyperSpec courtesy of the [GCL][] project.

Once installed, I found I could not easily lookup documentation for, say, `mapcar`, because it's actually on the page for `mapc`.  But [SLIME][]'s `hyperspec.el` contained the indexing info I needed to write a new module which fires up the Info system on the correct section for the symbol you want defined.

This new module is called `cl-info.el` and is available [from my Lisp repository][].  It rebinds the standard Emacs key for function help (`C-h f`) to lookup help in the HyperSpec instead, if you're in a `lisp-mode` buffer.

**NOTE**: A fellow Lisper pointed me to [this blog entry][] which offers a much nicer way to get the HyperSpec in Info form.  It's a little more work, but the quality of the result is superior and it has an index!  Also, it makes my `cl-info.el` unnecessary, by relying entirely on the Info system itself.
