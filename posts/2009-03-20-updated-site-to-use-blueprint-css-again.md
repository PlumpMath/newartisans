title: Updated site to use Blueprint CSS again
---

Recently I changed how the content on this site was generated, from using the standalone OS X application [RapidWeaver](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/), to the server-side publishing platform [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/).  During that transition I changed the site's style to the minimalist default offered by MT, which uses its own CSS for column layout and typography.

Tonight I finally got around to switching the site back to [blueprint-css](http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/), which I very much prefer.  I used the superb application [CSSEdit](http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/) to help me massage Movable Type's style into something that compatible with Blueprint's own typography and layout.

I hope the result is pleasing.  If anyone sees strange artifacts or display issues, please [let me know](mailto:johnw@newartisans.com).  I'm aware code examples were being truncated on the right side before, but this should be corrected now.  More on Haskell to come soon!
