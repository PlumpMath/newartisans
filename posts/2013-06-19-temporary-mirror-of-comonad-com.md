Until [the Comonad Reader](http://comonad.com) comes back online, I have a temporary mirror setup at [http://comonad.newartisans.com](http://comonad.newartisans.com).  It's a bit old (Sep 2012), but has some classics like "Free Monads for Less".  It is missing the "Algebra of Applicatives", though, since I hadn't run the mirror in a while.
