There is a new version of Ready Lisp for Mac OS X available.  This version is based on SBCL 1.0.24 and Aquamacs Emacs 1.6, and requires OS X Leopard 10.5.  The only changes in this version are upgrades of many of the dependent packages.

What is Ready Lisp?  It's a binding together of several popular Lisp packages for OS X, including: Aquamacs, SBCL and SLIME.  Once downloaded, you'll have a single application bundle which you can double-click -- and find yourself in a fully configured Common Lisp REPL.  It's ideal for OS X users who want to try out Lisp with a minimum of hassle.  [The download](ftp://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/lisp/ready-lisp/ReadyLisp.dmg.zip) is approximately 73 megabytes.
